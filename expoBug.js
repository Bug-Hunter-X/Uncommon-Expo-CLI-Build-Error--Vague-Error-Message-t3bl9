While building an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI.  The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the specific problem. The project built successfully on another machine, suggesting the issue might be environment-specific. I tried clearing the cache and reinstalling dependencies but that didn't resolve the problem. The error message was similar to this:  `Error: An unexpected error occurred while building the project. Check the logs for more details.`, but the logs themselves were not particularly helpful.
