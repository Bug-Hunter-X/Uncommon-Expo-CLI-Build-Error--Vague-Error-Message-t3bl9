The solution to this issue turned out to be related to environment variables.  Specifically, a mismatch in the Node.js version between my local machine and the machine where the build was successful was causing the problem. Ensuring that the Node.js version and npm/yarn versions are consistent resolved the error.  Additionally, checking for conflicting packages or outdated native modules can also help.  Here's how I fixed it:

1. **Checked Node.js version**: Used `node -v` to check my Node.js version.
2. **Checked npm version**: Used `npm -v` to verify npm version.
3. **Aligned Node.js and npm versions**: I used nvm (Node Version Manager) to switch to a version that matches the other machine. Then ran `npm install` again to make sure all dependencies were updated. 
4. **Cleaned the project**: Ran `expo prebuild --clean` to clear any old cached builds
5. **Rebuild the project**:  Re-ran the `expo build:android` command. 

By addressing the environment mismatch, the build process completed successfully.
